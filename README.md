## Objective

This project provided an analysis and proposal for the US and Columbia team rowing outlining better ways to measure and display training progress of their respective teams. The coaching staffs have all of the experience and knowledge of the sport to make a decision based on observation, but they need enhanced abilities to look at the big picture context of the program as a whole. There is inevitable bias when taking the subjective observation, even if that comes from an expert who may have the correct 'feel' for an athlete from that. 

Our goal was to look at a rowing teams training, preparation, and analysis of performance from a holistic perspective. This means that it included a better way for coaches to unify dashboards showing performance trends, as well as giving athletes an avenue to monitor their own progress athletically and mentally. In addition to monitoring the performance statistics that are quantifiable for the team, we also created a system to quantify mental and emotional health progression. 

**Hypothesis: Mentally and emotionally well- balanced athletes lead to faster rowing times.**
